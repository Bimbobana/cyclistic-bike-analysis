# 6. Recommendations

## Based on Findings, I Recommend:

1. **Target weekend casual riders with membership perks**  
   - Offer weekend ride bundles for new members.
   - Highlight cost savings vs. paying per ride.

2. **Promote memberships as a commuting solution**  
   - Partner with employers for subsidized memberships.
   - Showcase convenience of unlimited rides for work travel.

3. **Seasonal campaigns in winter**  
   - Discounted winter memberships to attract casual riders in low-demand months.
   - Emphasize availability of assistive and comfort bikes.

## Next Steps
- Expand analysis to a full 12-month dataset to confirm seasonal trends.
- Test targeted ads on weekends to measure membership conversions.
- Collect feedback from casual riders on barriers to membership.
